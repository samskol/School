To run the code you need the following command: python3 assignment8.py typos20.data > testfile.txt
testfile is included in the zip, you can use this for testing or something else.
The output is what I think you want. Starts with header emissions,emissions table, then header for transitions
transitions table, initial header with initial table, no white space in file.
