Graphics Final
fall 2016


r =switch to rain/fog scene

s =switch to snow scene 

w= move forward W=move backward

arrow keys= look around 

y= lower fog density

Y= lower fog density more

t= take fog density back to default value

H = switch off help statement

h = switch on help statement

x = get rid of all grass polygons. (grass polygons expensive computationally, will go into more detail later)

a= low number of grass polygons in center of map

d=medium number of grass polygons in center

g= fill map with grass polygons (slow)

P= more total particles ~90000

p= less particles - 10000

, = slow down particles

. = speed up particles

This will build the program: make clean
make
./FinalProject
